(If I keep searchin' I'm gon find myself)
In my feelings
I've been feeling more than usual
I got feelings I've been feeling
I need you to know
I'm not perfect but I'm sure
I'm certain
That's that toxic love that left me hurtin'
If I keep searchin' I'm gon' find myself, yeah
I know they hate to see me living well
Tell me you need real love
So I can give you that
I feel like I don't deserve your love
Wish I could give it back
I don't want no strings attached
I be cuttin' ties
I wasn't trynna rush into no label
But I had to make you mine
(But I'm sure I'm certain)
I know we've got forever
But it's feeling like we running out of time
(That's that toxic love that left me hurtin')
The feelin's I've been feeling
Got me feelin' like I'm running out of love
(I'm gon' find myself)
Ain't no competition but I'm feelin' like my love is not enough
(They hate you see me livin' well)
And I'm running out of options
In my feelings
I've been feeling more than usual
I got feelings I've been feeling
I need you to know
I'm not perfect but I'm sure
I'm certain
That's that toxic love that left me hurtin'
If I keep searchin' I'm gon' find myself, yeah
I know they hate to see me living well
