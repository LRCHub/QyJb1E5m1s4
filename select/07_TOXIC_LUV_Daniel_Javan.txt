Shawty give me toxic love
She tell me that she love me just to have some fun
And I keep running back even though I've had enough
I can't run
I can't hide
She the love of my life

Yeah
It's that toxic love
Shawty she keep telling me I'm not enough
Yeah, bout to have some fun
But when I do, I keep running back to love
I cannot lie to myself
I want you like nobody else
But shawty you put me through hell
I feel like I'm trapped in a cell

Shawty give me toxic love
She tell me that she love me just to have some fun
And I keep running back even though I've had enough
I can't run
I can't hide
She the love of my life

Tried to break out
I can't break free
Tried to get out
But I don't want you to hate me

Shawty give me toxic love
She tell me that she love me just to have some fun
And I keep running back even though I've had enough
I can't run
I can't hide
She the love of my life
